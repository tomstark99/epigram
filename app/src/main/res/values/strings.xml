    <string name="app_about">EPIGRAM\nVERSION: %s</string>
    <string name="app_about_general">In print and online, Epigram is the University of Bristol\’s independent student newspaper. We are run for students, by students, and have a combined readership of over 20,000. Our content is not controlled by the University or the Students Union and we remain politically neutral.\n\nWe welcome written pieces, videos, photography, art and poetry and our sections cover a wide variety of topics. Our lifestyle magazine, The Croft can be found inside every copy of Epigram and online featuring Wellbeing, Style, Food and Travel.\n\nEpigram is printed fortnightly and can be found around campus, in cafes and student accommodation. We have a large editorial and business team who work hard, alongside their degrees, to create Epigram for both print and online.
    </string>
    <string name="app_about_history">Epigram was founded in 1988 by James Landale, now Diplomatic Correspondent for BBC News. Former Editor of The Daily Telegraph, William Lewis was a writer for the newspaper in these early years.\n\nBefore Epigram, there had been The Bristol Nonesuch which was launched in 1911 and continued until the 1960s. The name is now used for the University\’s alumni magazine. BACCUS followed Nonesuch, but was denounced as NUS propaganda and funding was withdrawn by the Student\’s Union in the late 1980s.\n\nNotable Epigram alumni include Susanna Reid who was Editor-in-Chief between 1990 and 1991 and Krissi Murison, once Music Editor, who is now the Deputy Editor of The Sunday Times Magazine.\n\nAs of May 2019, the newspaper has reached 339 print editions and we continue to grow our online presence including on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
